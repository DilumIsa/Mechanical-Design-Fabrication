Based on your images and description, you have designed a specialized fabrication tool.

Here is a name and description for your product:

### Tool Name

A good name for this tool would be an **Adjustable Angle Welding Fixture** or an **Adjustable Corner Welding Jig**.

### Product Description

This is an **Adjustable Angle Welding Fixture** designed to simplify the fabrication of angled joints. Its primary purpose is to securely hold two pieces of metal (such as flat bars or plates) at a precise, adjustable angle, allowing a single operator to perform welding without needing a second person to hold the workpieces.

**Key Features:**

* **Adjustable Angle:** The linkage bar on the underside allows the two main body sections to be set and locked at various angles, making it versatile for different projects.
* **Secure Clamping:** The top clamping blocks (the brown parts) and bolts are used to firmly press the workpieces against the fixture, ensuring they remain perfectly still and aligned during the welding process.
* **Welding-Ready Design:** The copper-colored plates on the fixture faces are a critical feature. Copper is an excellent choice as it resists weld spatter (the hot, molten metal blobs) and helps dissipate heat, protecting the fixture and ensuring a cleaner weld.
* **Solo Operation:** By firmly gripping both workpieces in the correct orientation, this jig acts as a "second set of hands," solving the common problem of parts shifting while trying to tack-weld them.

In short, this tool is a robust, adjustable jig that guarantees accurate alignment and stability for welding corner joints, significantly improving efficiency and weld quality for a single fabricator.
